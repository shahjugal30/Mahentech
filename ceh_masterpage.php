				</h2>
				<p align="justify">To be placed at the tip of your organization’s cyber spear, you must be confident,
					proficient in your job, and be at the top of your game. You must be able to think on your feet, act
					quickly, appropriately, and proportionally. Make a mistake and bad things can happen.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">CEH Master gives you the opportunity to prove to your employer, your peers, and most
					importantly to yourself that you can in fact take on and overcome challenges found in everyday life
					as an Ethical Hacker. To prove this, though, we don’t give you exam simulations. We test your
					abilities with real-world challenges in a realworld environment, and with a time limit, just as you
					would find in your job.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">Do you run towards danger? Do you take charge during unsettling and challenging
					times? Do you want to be the one your team can rely on to take the fight to the bad guys? If your
					answers are yes, prove yourself with CEH Master!

					<span style="color:red;">WHAT</span> IS C|EH MASTER
				</h2>
				<p align="justify" style="font-size:20px">CEH Master is the brainchild of our CEO, Jay Bavisi. It is the
					next evolution for the world-renowned Certified Ethical Hacker program, and a logical ‘next step’
					for those holding this prestigious certification. CEH is meant to be the foundation for anyone
					seeking to be an Ethical Hacker. The CEH Practical Exam was developed to give Ethical Hackers the
					chance to prove their Ethical Hacking skills and abilities. Earning the CEH Master designation is
					your way of saying, “I learned it, I know it, I proved it.”
				</p>
				<p align="justify" style="font-size:20px">To earn the CEH Master designation you must successfully
					demonstrate your knowledge of Ethical Hacking through two distinctly different proving grounds.
					First, you must attempt and successfully pass the ANSI Accredited Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)
					multiple choice exam. Once you complete this first step, you can move on to the second part of
					earning the CEH Master designation, the CEH Practical Exam.
