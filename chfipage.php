				<p align="justify">Computer hacking forensic investigation is the process of detecting hacking attacks
					and properly extracting evidence to report the crime and conduct audits to prevent future attacks.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">Computer crime in today’s cyber world is on the rise. Computer Investigation
					techniques are being used by police, government and corporate entities globally and many of them
					turn to EC-Council for our Digital Forensic Investigator CHFI Certification Program.</p>
				<p align="justify">Computer Security and Computer investigations are changing terms. More tools are
					invented daily for conducting Computer Investigations, be it computer crime, digital forensics,
					computer investigations, or even standard computer data recovery. The tools and techniques covered
					in EC-Council’s CHFI program will prepare the student to conduct computer investigations using
					groundbreaking digital forensics technologies.</p>
				<p align="justify">Computer forensics is simply the application of computer investigation and analysis
					techniques in the interests of determining potential legal evidence. Evidence might be sought in a
					wide range of computer crime or misuse, including but not limited to theft of trade secrets, theft
					of or destruction of intellectual property, and fraud. CHFI investigators can draw on an array of
					methods for discovering data that resides in a computer system, or recovering deleted, encrypted, or
					damaged file information known as computer data recovery.</p>

				<h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>Passing Score</b></h2>
				<p align="justify"> In order to maintain the high integrity of our certification exams, EC-Council Exams
					are
					provided in
					multiple forms
					(i.e., different question banks). Each form is carefully analyzed through beta testing with an
					appropriate sample group
					under the purview of a committee of subject matter experts that ensure that each of our exams not
					only
					has academic
					rigor but also has “real world” applicability. We also have a process to determine the difficulty
					rating
					of each
					question. The individual rating then contributes to an overall “Cut Score” for each exam form. To
					ensure
					each form has
					equal assessment standards, cut scores are set on a “per exam form” basis. Depending on which exam
					form
					is challenged,
					cut scores can range from 60% to 85%.</p>

			<p>Digital forensics is a key component in Cyber Security. Many people hear the term forensics, or computer
				forensics, or digital forensics and instantly think that’s just for law enforcement, but the truth is,
				digital
				forensics has a key place on every cyber security team. In fact, without it, chances are your
				organization’s
				security posture and maturity will fail to see its full potential. Computer forensics is an evolving
				field that
				is always moving to match the changes in devices and how they are used for identifying, preserving,
				analyzing,
				and recovering data from computers and various digital media storage. Digital data are subjected to
				legal
				practices and guidelines when intended to serve as evidence in civil proceedings. To learn more about
