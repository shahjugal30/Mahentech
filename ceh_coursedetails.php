            <h3>Passing Score</h3>
            <p>
                In order to maintain the high integrity of our certifications exams, EC-Council Exams are provided in
                multiple forms (I.e. different question banks). Each form is carefully analyzed through beta testing
                with an appropriate sample group under the purview
                of a committee of subject matter experts that ensure that each of our exams not only has academic rigor
                but also has “real world” applicability. We also have a process to determine the difficulty rating of
                each question. The individual rating
                then contributes to an overall “Cut Score” for each exam form. To ensure each form has equal assessment
                standards, cut scores are set on a “per exam form” basis. Depending on which exam form is challenged,
                cut scores can range from 60% to
                85%.
