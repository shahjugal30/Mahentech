				<p align="justify">The Certified Application Security Engineer (CASE) credential is developed in
					partnership with large application and software development experts globally.</p>
				<p align="justify">The CASE credential tests the critical security skills and knowledge required
					throughout a typical software development life cycle (SDLC), focusing on the importance of the
					implementation of secure methodologies and practices in todayâ€™s insecure operating environment.</p>
				<p align="justify">The CASE certified training program is developed concurrently to prepare software
					professionals with the necessary capabilities that are expected by employers and academia
					globally.It is designed to be a hands-on, comprehensive application security course that will help
					software professionals create secure applications.
					The training program encompasses security activities involved in all phases of the Software
					Development Lifecycle (SDLC): planning, creating, testing, and deploying an application.
				</p>
				<p align="justify">Unlike other application security trainings, CASE goes beyond just the guidelines on
					secure coding practices and includes secure requirement gathering, robust application design, and
					handling security issues in post development phases of application development.</p>
				<p align="justify">This makes CASE one of the most comprehensive certifications on the market today. It
					is desired by software application engineers, analysts, testers globally, and respected by hiring
					authorities.</p>

				<strong style="font-size:30px;">The Purpose of CASE Is</strong>
				<ol style="padding-left:30px">
					<li>
						To ensure that application security is no longer an afterthought but a foremost one.
					</li>
					<li>
						To lay the foundation required by all application developers and development organizations, to
						produce secure applications with greater stability and fewer security risks to the consumer,
						therefore, making security a foremost thought.
					</li>
					<li>To ensure that the organizations mitigate the risk of losing millions due to security
						compromises that may arise with every step of application development process.</li>
					<li>To help individuals develop the habit of giving importance to security sacrosanct of their job
						role in the SDLC, therefore opening security as the main domain for testers, developers, network
						administrator etc.</li>

			<p align="justify">The .Net framework has increased in popularity because of its open source nature,
				interoperability, language independence, library of codes and ease of deployment. It has become the
				preferred choice of application developers. However, there are not many training programs that
				address secure application development.</p>
			<p align="justify">While .Net developers often learn security on the job, primarily because the basic
				education of programming does not usually cover or emphasize security concerns, the CASE program
				trains these developers to place importance on security.</p>
