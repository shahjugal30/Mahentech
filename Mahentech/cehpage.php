                <p align="justify">The Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) program is the most comprehensive ethical hacking
                    course on the globe to help information security professionals grasp the fundamentals of ethical
                    hacking. The hacking course outcome helps you become a professional who systematically attempts to
                    inspect network infrastructures with the consent of
                    its owner to find security vulnerabilities which a malicious hacker could potentially exploit. This
                    hacking course helps you assess the security posture of an organization by identifying
                    vulnerabilities in the network and system
                    infrastructure to determine if unauthorized access is possible. The CEH is the first of a series of
                    3 comprehensive courses (CEH, ECSA and the APT course) to help a cyber security professional master
                    penetration testing.</p>
