                    <p>With the sudden rise in the Internet usage across the globe over the past few years, there has
                        also been a rise in the amount of online scams and frauds. Today, most of the Internet users are
                        unaware of the most prevailing online threats
                        which pose a real challenge for their safe Internet usage. As a result, the security has become
                        a questionable factor for the most Internet users.</p>

                <p style=" text-align: justify; font-size: larger;">
                    However, it is still possible to effectively combat insecurity on the Internet provided that, the
                    users are well aware of the common scams and frauds and know how to protect themselves. A study
                    shows that over 91 percent of the Internet users are unaware
                    of the online scams and are therefore worried about their security. If you are one among those 91
                    percent, then this post is just for you!
