                    testing skills.</p>
                <p align="justify">ECSA (Practical) presents you with an organization and its network environment,
                    containing multiple hosts. The internal network consists of several subnets housing various
                    organizational units. It is made up of militarized and demilitarized zones, connected with a huge
                    pool of database servers in a database zone. As a security precaution, and by design, all the
                    internal resource zones are confiÂ­gured with different subnet IPs. The militarized zone houses the
                    domain controllers and application servers that provide application frameworks for various
                    departments of the organization.</p>

                    that
                    is presented in the ECSA program, and are required to perform a comprehensive security audit of an
                    organization, just like in the real world. You will start with challenges requiring you to perform
                    advanced network scans beyond perimeter defenses, leading to automated and manual vulnerability
                    analysis, exploit selection, customization, launch, and post exploitation maneuvers.</p>
